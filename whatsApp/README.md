 I made a Whatsapp chat interface using HTML and CSS. It shows what a chat on WhatsApp would look like if you were using the application. 

 I had some challenges with the responsiveness so it is not fully responsive and can only be viewed through a laptop screen. I am currently working on making it fully responsive

 This project can be viewed on any web browser and does not require any additional tools.
